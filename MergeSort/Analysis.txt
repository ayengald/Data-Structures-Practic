Merge sort is a stable sort which uses divide and conquer technique, and the same time complexities in both its worst and best cases.
The number of iterations in best case is almost half that of in worst case.
The merge() function runs in O(n) for n elements and mergesort() function runs in O(nlogn) time.
 

The asymptotic running time is somewhere between O(nlogn) and O(nlogn).(Both worst and best cases have a time complexity of nlogn,although the best case results in about half of the iterations as compared to that of the worst case.)

This can be seen in the results as doubling the input results in approximately...
